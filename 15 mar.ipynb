    "1) Artificial Intelligence (AI):\n",
    "   - Definition:Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and mimic human actions. It involves the development of algorithms that enable computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, learning from experience, and making decisions.\n",
    "   - Example: An example of AI in action is virtual assistants like Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, or Google Assistant. These AI-powered systems use natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to understand and respond to user queries, perform tasks like setting reminders, playing music, or providing weather updates, and continually learn from user interactions to improve their performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Machine Learning (ML):\n",
    "   - Definition: Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data, without being explicitly programmed to perform specific tasks. ML algorithms iteratively learn from data, identify patterns, and make data-driven decisions.\n",
    "   - Example:An example of machine learning is a spam email filter. The filter learns from labeled examples of spam and non-spam emails to distinguish between them. It analyzes email content, sender information, and other features to classify incoming emails as spam or not spam. Over time, the filter improves its accuracy by learning from user feedback on its classifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Deep Learning:\n",
    "   - Definition: Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that utilizes artificial neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks) to learn representations of data. It aims to automatically learn hierarchical representations of data by composing simple but nonlinear transformations of input data through multiple layers.\n",
    "   - Example: An example of deep learning is image recognition systems. For instance, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning model, can be trained to recognize objects in images. By learning from labeled images, a CNN can identify various objects such as cats, dogs, cars, or people in new, unseen images with high accuracy.\n"
