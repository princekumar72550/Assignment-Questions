    "Ridge regression is a statistical regularization technique. It corrects for overfitting on training data in machine learning\n",
    "models. Ridge regression—also known as L2 regularization—is one of several types of regularization for linear regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Objective Function:\n",
    "   - In OLS regression, the objective is to minimize the sum of squared residuals, which measures the difference between the actual values and the predicted values. The objective function can be written as:\n",
    "     \\[ \\text{minimize} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 \\right) \\]\n",
    "   - In Ridge regression, a penalty term proportional to the squared magnitudes of the coefficients is added to the OLS objective function. The objective function becomes:\n",
    "     \\[ \\text{minimize} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^{p} \\beta_j^2 \\right) \\]\n",
    "   - Where \\( \\lambda \\) is the regularization parameter that controls the strength of the penalty term, \\( \\beta_j \\) are the coefficients, and \\( p \\) is the number of predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Regularization Parameter (\\( \\lambda \\)):\n",
    "   - The regularization parameter (\\( \\lambda \\)) is a non-negative hyperparameter that determines the trade-off between fitting the training data well and keeping the coefficients small. A larger \\( \\lambda \\) leads to greater shrinkage of coefficients towards zero.\n",
    "   - When \\( \\lambda = 0 \\), Ridge regression reduces to OLS regression, as there is no penalty term added to the objective function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Shrinkage of Coefficients:\n",
    "   - Ridge regression shrinks the coefficients towards zero by penalizing large coefficient values. However, it does not force coefficients to exactly zero, except in cases of perfect multicollinearity.\n",
    "   - The penalty term encourages the model to distribute the coefficients more evenly across predictors, thereby reducing the variance of the model and improving its generalization performance."

    "1. Cross-Validation:\n",
    "   - Cross-validation is one of the most widely used methods for selecting the value of \\( \\lambda \\) in Ridge Regression.\n",
    "   - The dataset is randomly split into multiple subsets (e.g., k-fold cross-validation), where one subset is used as the validation set and the remaining subsets are used for training.\n",
    "   - The model is trained on each training subset with different values of \\( \\lambda \\), and the performance is evaluated on the validation subset.\n",
    "   - The value of \\( \\lambda \\) that yields the best performance (e.g., lowest mean squared error or highest \\( R^2 \\)) on the validation set is selected as the optimal value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Grid Search:\n",
    "   - Grid search is a systematic approach where a range of \\( \\lambda \\) values are predefined, and the model is trained and evaluated for each value in the range.\n",
    "   - The optimal value of \\( \\lambda \\) is determined based on the performance metric (e.g., mean squared error, \\( R^2 \\)) on a validation set.\n",

    "3. Regularization Path:\n",
    "   - The regularization path method involves fitting the Ridge Regression model for a sequence of \\( \\lambda \\) values, typically spanning several orders of magnitude.\n",

    "   - In some cases, domain knowledge or prior information about the problem may guide the selection of \\( \\lambda \\).\n",

    "1. Stabilization of Coefficient Estimates:\n",
    "   - In the presence of multicollinearity, the estimated coefficients in OLS regression can be highly unstable and sensitive to small changes in the data. Ridge Regression addresses this issue by shrinking the coefficients towards zero, effectively reducing their variance and stabilizing the estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Reduction of Coefficient Magnitudes:\n",
    "   - Ridge Regression penalizes large coefficient values by adding a regularization term to the objective function. As a result, the magnitude of the coefficients is reduced, which can help mitigate the problem of inflated coefficients that often arises in the presence of multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",

    "4. Improved Generalization Performance:\n",
    "   - By reducing the variance of the coefficient estimates, Ridge Regression can lead to a more generalizable model that performs better on unseen data, even in the presence of multicollinearity. This is because the model is less likely\n",

The regularization parameter (\\( \\lambda \\)) controls the trade-off between bias and variance. Larger values of \\( \\lambda \\) result in greater shrinkage of coefficients and higher bias but lower variance.\n",
