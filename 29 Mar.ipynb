    "estimate the relationships between variables and make predictions. LASSO stands for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection \n",
    "Operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Regularization Technique:\n",
    "   - Lasso Regression is a type of regularization technique, along with Ridge Regression and Elastic Net Regression. Regularization techniques add a penalty term to the objective function to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Feature Selection:\n",
    "   - One of the key differences between Lasso Regression and other regression techniques like Ridge Regression is its ability to perform feature selection. Lasso Regression tends to set some coefficients exactly to zero, effectively excluding irrelevant predictors from the model.\n",
    "   - This feature selection property makes Lasso Regression particularly useful in situations where the number of predictors is large relative to the number of observations or when there is multicollinearity among predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Sparsity:\n",
    "   - Lasso Regression produces sparse models, meaning that it selects only a subset of predictors with non-zero coefficients in the final model. This can lead to simpler and more interpretable models compared to techniques like OLS regression or Ridge Regression, which often include all predictors in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Penalty Term:\n",
    "   - In Lasso Regression, the penalty term added to the objective function is proportional to the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients (\\( \\sum_{j=1}^{p} |\\beta_j| \\)), where \\( \\beta_j \\) are the coefficients and \\( p \\) is the number of predictors.\n",
    "   - This penalty term encourages sparsity in the model and promotes coefficient shrinkage, but it can also lead to some coefficients being exactly zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Variable Selection Trade-off:\n",
    "   - Lasso Regression introduces a trade-off between fitting the data well and having a simpler model with fewer predictors. As the regularization parameter increases, more coefficients are driven to zero, resulting in a simpler model but potentially sacrificing some predictive performance."

    "1. Automatic Feature Selection: Lasso Regression performs feature selection as part of the model fitting process, automatically identifying and selecting the most informative predictors from a potentially large pool of candidate variables. This eliminates the need for manual feature selection techniques, which can be time-consuming and prone to human bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Simplicity and Interpretability:By selecting only a subset of predictors with non-zero coefficients, Lasso Regression produces a simpler and more interpretable model. The reduced number of predictors makes it easier to understand the factors driving the response variable, facilitating insights and decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Improved Generalization Performance: By excluding irrelevant predictors from the model, Lasso Regression reduces the risk of overfitting and improves the generalization performance of the model on unseen data. This can lead to more accurate predictions and better model performance in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Handling Multicollinearity: Lasso Regression is effective at handling multicollinearity (high correlation between predictors) by selecting one of the correlated predictors and setting the coefficients of others to zero. This helps alleviate issues associated with multicollinearity and stabilizes coefficient estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Computational Efficiency: Lasso Regression can efficiently handle high-dimensional datasets with a large number of predictors. The ability to perform feature selection during the model fitting process reduces the computational burden compared to methods that involve exhaustive search or manual selection of predictors."

    "   - One approach to using Lasso Regression for non-linear regression problems is to engineer non-linear features from the original predictor variables.\n",
