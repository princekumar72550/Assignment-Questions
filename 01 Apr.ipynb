    "   - Instead of predicting the actual value of the target variable, logistic regression predicts the probability that a given input belongs to a certain category.\n",
    "   - The output of logistic regression is a probability score between 0 and 1, which can be converted into a binary outcome using a threshold.\n",
    "   - The logistic regression model applies a sigmoid function to the linear combination of the independent variables to constrain the output between 0 and 1. The equation of logistic regression is:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     p = 1 / (1 + exp(-(β0 + β1*x)))\n",

    "Feature selection is crucial in logistic regression to improve model performance, reduce overfitting, and enhance interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Univariate Feature Selection:This method evaluates each feature individually and selects the best-performing features based on statistical tests like chi-square test, ANOVA, or mutual information. Features with high scores are retained, while others are discarded. This method is simple and computationally efficient but may overlook interactions between features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE): RFE recursively removes the least important features and fits the model until the specified number of features is reached. It ranks features based on their importance and eliminates the least significant ones in each iteration. RFE helps to identify the most relevant features for the model and can handle feature interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. L1 Regularization (Lasso Regression): As mentioned earlier, L1 regularization adds a penalty term to the cost function, which encourages sparse solutions by shrinking less important feature coefficients towards zero. Features with zero coefficients are effectively excluded from the model, leading to automatic feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Feature Importance from Tree-Based Models: Tree-based models like decision trees and random forests can provide feature importance scores based on how much each feature contributes to the model's performance. Features with higher importance scores are considered more informative and can be selected for logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA transforms the original features into a new set of orthogonal features called principal components. These components capture the maximum variance in the data. By selecting a subset of principal components that explain most of the variance, PCA can effectively reduce the dimensionality of the feature space while preserving most of the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Forward/Backward Selection: Forward selection starts with an empty set of features and iteratively adds the most significant feature based on a chosen criterion (e.g., AIC, BIC, likelihood ratio test) until a stopping criterion is met. In contrast, backward selection starts with all features and removes the least significant feature in each step until the stopping criterion is satisfied. These methods can be computationally intensive but provide a more exhaustive search for the best subset of features.\n"

    "1. Resampling Techniques:\n",
    "   - Undersampling: Randomly remove instances from the majority class to balance the class distribution. This may lead to information loss, especially if the majority class contains important patterns.\n",

    "   - Assign different misclassification costs to different classes, penalizing misclassification of the minority class more heavily. This can be achieved by adjusting the class weights in the logistic regression algorithm.\n",

    "   - Algorithm Tuning: Adjust the hyperparameters of the logistic regression algorithm to better handle class imbalance. For example, you can adjust the regularization strength or the threshold for classification.\n",

    "4. Evaluation Metrics:\n",
    "   - Use evaluation metrics that are more robust to class imbalance, such as precision, recall, F1-score, or area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR). These metrics provide a more comprehensive assessment of model performance than accuracy, especially in imbalanced datasets.\n",
