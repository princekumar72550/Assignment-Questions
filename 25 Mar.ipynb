    "     - Mean/Median Imputation: Fill missing values with the mean or median of the column.\n",

    "     - Domain-Specific Imputation: Impute based on domain knowledge (e.g., time series, categorical data).\n",
    "   - Indicator Variables: Create binary indicators for missing values (e.g., a new column indicating missing data).\n",

    "4. Visualizing Missing Data:\n",
