    "\n",
    "why data leakage is a problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Overfitting: Data leakage can lead to overfitting, where the model captures patterns in the training data that do not generalize to new data. This happens because the model learns patterns that are specific to the training dataset but not present in the real-world data it will encounter during deployment.\n",

    "2. Biased Performance Estimates: Leakage can artificially inflate the performance metrics of a model during training and evaluation. As a result, the model may appear to perform well on the validation or test set, but it fails to generalize to new, unseen data because it has learned to exploit unintended patterns or information present in the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Invalid Results: In some cases, data leakage can lead to invalid results or conclusions. For example, if information from the future is inadvertently included in the training data when predicting past events, the model may seem to have predictive power when, in fact, it is just leveraging future information."

    "1. Understand the Data and Domain: Gain a thorough understanding of the data and the problem domain. This involves understanding how the data was collected, what each feature represents, and the potential sources of leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Feature Engineering: Be cautious when creating features from the data. Ensure that features are derived solely from information that would be available at the time of prediction and are not influenced by the target variable. Avoid using features that contain information about the target variable or could introduce leakage, such as future information, identifiers directly associated with the target, or derived features that involve knowledge of the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Separate Training, Validation, and Test Sets Properly: Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets before any preprocessing steps to ensure that there is no data leakage during the splitting process. Make sure that data used for validation and testing represent unseen data and are not exposed to the model during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Temporal Splitting: If dealing with time-series data, use a temporal splitting strategy where the training set contains data from earlier time periods, the validation set contains data from intermediate time periods, and the test set contains data from the latest time period. This prevents future information from leaking into the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Cross-Validation: Use appropriate cross-validation techniques, such as k-fold cross-validation or time-series cross-validation, to evaluate model performance.
